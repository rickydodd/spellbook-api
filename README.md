# Spellbooks API
## Brief
Spellbooks API is a web-based API for storing and querying spellbooks, fictional books with a fantasy flavour.

## Purpose
The intent of this project is as an exercise. go version 1.21 introduced new standard library functionality for routing, so I wanted to explore that. I also wanted to begin with an in-memory implementation of data objects, before then transitioning to persistent storage. This is just what I consider to be fun, put frankly.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Complete in-memory implementation.
- [x] Setup basic continuous integration.
- [ ] Selection and integration of an appropriate database solution.
- [ ] Further the roadmap.
